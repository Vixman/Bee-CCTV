We are Bioinformatics students at Wroclaw University of Environmental and Life Sciences.Faced with technological needs, we decided
to create a universal monitoring system. With the main purpose for animal breeders, including hatchers who want to observe their
object of interest in native conditions. Thanks to our software, we improve reality by introducing new areas to the Internet of
Things.

@The IoT sector, which is constantly developing, finds its application in more and more new fields of science. 
The effect of this trend is the Universal Monitoring System that allows observation of places that have been difficult or 
unavailable to humans so far. Such application enables 24-hour monitoring of the indicated place, at the same time reducing 
the costs of standard methods and allows for immediate intervention if necessary.
